Software Development Student - Instituto Federal de São Paulo

I am currently studying Systems Development at IFSP-SPO. I also study subjects that interest me in the technology area, such as software architecture, data structures and databases. 

Along with these studies, I seek to expand the knowledge I already have in programming logic and some languages ​​such as C# and Python, so that I can soon start some personal projects to apply the content I have learned.
