Systems Development Student - Instituto Federal de SÃ£o Paulo

I am currently studying Systems Development at IFSP-SPO. I also explore topics of personal interest in the technology field, such as software architecture, data structures, and databases.

In addition to these studies, I strive to expand my knowledge in programming logic and languages like C# and Python, aiming to start some personal projects soon to apply the concepts I have learned.
